TODO:

Submit the packages in starter-kit-elpa.el to ELPA.

Greg Newman is working on Python helpers.

maybe include:
* should yasnippet be included in rinari?

to write/finish:
* submit ruby fixes to flymake

which-func-mode in ruby?

Bug fixes:
get jabber.el to automatically disconnect when suspending/hibernating
(via dbus)

overhaul starter-kit-* core and restructure as init/*.el

BAD OVERRIDES:
M-$: new ispell-{word,region} - must rebind for osx
[new] file-cache-minibuffer-complete

PACKAGES (and equivalents, if possible):
browse-kill-ring : +kill-ring-search!
install-elisp
ruby-hacks ?
ruby-style ?
shell-command (+shell-current-directory?)
yasnippet
yank-pop-summary

NOTES:
M-$ : spellchecking for region if mark is active, word otherwise
TAB now indents region

FIX
exec-path not setting to my PATH
magit's git-executable-path
